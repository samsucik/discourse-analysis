## Task
_Nur (2015) and Ruijuan (2010) have examined the interpersonal dimension in Mandela’s inauguration and in Obama’s victory speech respectively. Using these two studies as a starting point, investigate the same interpersonal dimension in a different political speech in order to see how generalizable Nur and Ruijuan’s results are. Variation may be: a politician with a different inclination, the same politician (Mandela or Obama) on a different occasion, a different type of audience, etc._

## Questions
- I chose to analyse Obama's inauguration speech from January 2009. Should the focus be on doing the same kind of analysis to Nur and Ye, and **then** comparing my findings with theirs, or instead focusing the analysis itself on examining the very same elements they examined, and comparing as I go? To what extent is it important to relate the differences to the different purposes/audiences, besides just stating that there are differences and therefore the particular findings of Nur & Ye don't generalise too well?
- should it be in the format of an article, like Ye and Nur? it doesn't have to have an abstract (given the strict word limit), does it?
- do excerpts from the data count towards the word limit?
- is some sort of recommendation or other practical form of lesson to learn desirable? (both Nur and Ye have it)
- how important is it to support claims with citations? e.g. "In political speech, the use of you elicits a dialogic style (Li:2000)" is something I could just write as my own thought. Also, Ye (2015) simply writes "The purpose of a speech is to express the addresser’s viewpoint on things in the world, to elicit or change the audience’s attitudes and to arouse the audiences’ passion to share the same proposal of the addresser." without a source.
- on the other hand, citing can be even a bit silly in the context of obvious claims: "According to Li (2002), personal pronouns have the interpersonal function in discourse." (Ye, 2015)

## Useful points
- imperatives: are they really commanding, or rather encouraging "acting together"? cite Halliday (1970)
- interrogative clauses: are they rhethorical questions or not? 
- idea can be served as a question simply to attract more attention (foregrounding?): my own thought
- 'we' can be inclusive or exclusive
- victory speech is less about the program/plans than an inauguration speech
- Mandela's speech was an inauguration speech, although the inauguration took place just 14 days after the (general) election. Hence, the speech can be considered somewhat a victory speech, too, maybe?

## Nur (2015)
- "According to Halliday (2006), a text can be visioned from two directions: by focusing on the text as an object in its own right and by focusing on the text as an instrument to reveal something else."
- "This paper makes use of the inauguration speech of Nelson Mandela (1994) and tries to explicate how interpersonal metafunction is being served here."
- 4 metafunctions (Halliday and Matthiessen, 2004: 61): experiential, interpersonal, textual, logical. + nice descriptions of each from Thompson (1996).
-  Strands of Meaning: Ideational, interpersonal and textual (Halliday, 2000)
- "Interpersonally, the grammar is not a theory but a way of doing; it is our construction of social relationships, both those that define society and our own place in it, and those that pertain to the immediate dialogic situation. This constitutes the "interpersonal" metafunction, whereby language constructs our social collective and, thereby, our _personal_ being." (Halliday & Matthiessen, 1999)
- "The interpersonal metafunction comprehends a text's tenor or interactivity which is again comprised with three components: 
  - the speaker/writer persona (whether the writer or speaker has a neutral attitude, which can be seen through the use of positive or negative language) 
  - social distance (how close the speakers are), and 
  - relative social status (whether they are equal in terms of power and knowledge on a subject)"
- praising Mandela and his speeches, which is then used as a justification for using this particular speech as a subject of the case study.
- "the Interpersonal Metafunction, claimed by Halliday (2009) mainly focuses on the relation between the role of speakers and the role of audience, mood and modality. "
- **Mood** (means of exchange -- "speech functions"). The Mood carries the interpersonal functions of the clause and consists of Subject+Finite. (The Subject is realised by a nominal group that the speaker gives responsibility to for the validity of the clause, while the Finite is realized by the first functional element of the verbal group.)
  - statement (declarative) 36/41. "...the dominant usage of declarative clauses in Mandela’s speech makes it more solemn, convincing, and persuasive and thus gives it a thriving look where he succeeded in recalling his and his countrymen’s long crucial sufferings, expressing his gratitude to his cowarriors and supporters and making promises and inspiring the audience to work for the actual freedom."
  - question (interrogative): 0
  - offer...
  - command (imperative): 5/41. "To Halliday (1970), imperative clauses convey two types of messages: one is to command others to do something, while the other is to invite the audience to do something or achieve something together."
- **Modality**: "modality refers to the areas of meaning that lies between yes and no—the intermediate ground between positive and negative polarity." (Halliday (1994)
  - "Thompson (2000:57) classified modality into two broad categories: Modalization and Modulation"
  - Modalization ("speaker’s judgment towards the validity of the proposition by covering the scale of probability (possible-probable-certain) and usuality (sometimes-usually-always).")
    - "modal verbs (can/could, may/might, shall/should, must, etc.), adjectives (possible, certain, probable, inevitable, etc.), adverbs (probably, likely, perhaps, rarely, etc.), nouns (likelihood, possibility, probability, etc.), and other devices (in my opinion, in all likelihood, it seems that…, etc.)"
  - Modulation "speaker’s sense of obligation (allowed-supposed-required) and inclination (willing-keen-determined)."
    - e.g. "modal verbs (must, should, ought to, etc.), adjectives (compulsory, mandatory, willing, etc.), adverbs (necessarily, willingly, etc.), and other forms (be required to, be inclined to, etc.)"
  - Modal verb operators
  	- "Will": 6x ("Will as a predicator of the future and then Will as a symbol of strong wish and determination")
  	- "Must": 3x "highest scale of modal commitment (Halliday: 1994)"
  	  - "most political speeches adopt Must to convey the speaker’s strong determination and also call on the audience to be determined to take action to achieve their common objectives"
  	- "can/could": 1+1x "a low scale of modal commitment". Mandela "encourage his people to believe in their abilities to do something together" + "is minimizing the gap between him and his fellow people"
- **Personal pronouns** "the choice of personal pronoun can clearly make the audience know the attitude of the speaker. It can establish the social relationship between the speaker and audience in a speech."
  - First Personal Pronoun system: 72.45%
    - we (33.75%): "Mandela intentionally used the highest proportion of the plural form we and its anamorphous to arouse the feeling in the audience that the speaker is on the side of the audience."
      - exclusive vs inclusive we (comes from SFL)
    - us (11.25%) (we's anamorphous)
    - our (26.25%)
    - I (1.2%)
    - "The combination of We, Our and Us in the above sentences reflects the integration of Mandela’s government with South African people: it creates Mandela and his party’s image with the sense of gratitude, obligation, high spirit and powerful authority that is determined to achieve as well as to protect its people and their freedom."
  - Second Personal pronoun system (2.5%)
    - "In political speech, the use of you elicits a dialogic style (Li:2000)". + drawing attention + separating speaker vs audience
  - Third Personal pronoun system (24.95%) "In traditional grammar, they is often used to refer to those people who are absent. In political speech, they can have the effect of realizing interpersonal meaning"
    - "By using they, them, their in the above sentences, Mandela shows his care and respect to people who sacrificed their lives during the long-lasted struggle and also invites the audience to feel the same"
  - Pronoun modifier 'All' (15x) "demonstrates [Mandela's] challenge to unite the divided communities"
- **Rhythmic feature of words**
  - "the anaphoric style of Mandela’s phrasing promotes the reconciliation agenda that was to be the hallmark of his long struggle and his effective presidency: his motivational and uplifting commitment inspired both the black and white people to bridge the chasm that divided the humanity into two communities."
  - "The use of metaphor in the above mentioned sentences acknowledges Mandela’s attempt to make both black and white audience to recognize the momentum that the history is going to make."
- **Conclusions**
  - "the use of mood and personal pronoun outweighs the use of modals and rhythmic lexical features; but all together they work within the same frame to explicate the speaker’s interpersonal metafunction"
  - "different uses of mood, modals, personal pronouns and rhythmic features of words can convey different levels of interpersonal meaning: different status, purpose, meaning and relationship between the speaker and the audience."
  - Recommendations
    - "Use of appropriate quantity of positive declarative clauses to transmit messages to the audience clearly and directly; appropriate application of imperative clauses to persuade and suggest."
    - "Use of modals under the highest modal commitment to show the speaker’s strong spirit and determination to achieve any task and also to promote audience’s onfidence in their ability"
	- "Use of personal pronoun, especially we-our-you-their pattern to abridge the speaker –audience distance by creating a dialogic style and also by pleading the audience to share the same feelings and attitude."

## Ye (2010)
- "This paper carries on a tentative interpersonal metafunction analysis of Barack Obama's Victory Speech from the Interpersonal Metafunction, which aims to help readers understand and evaluate the speech regarding its suitability, thus to provide some guidance for readers to make better speeches."
- Implications:
  - "Positive declarative clauses are recommended to convey information and convince the audiences with positive facts."
  - "Modal verbal operators with high modal commitment can show the addresser’s firm determination to finish tasks and build up the addresser’s authority."
  - "The frequent applications of “we” and “we”-“you”-“we” pattern help to create an intimate dialogic style, which can shorten the distance between the addresser and the audience and further persuade the audience to share the same proposal of the addresser."
- "context of a situation is arranged in three categories: field, tenor and mode." Halliday (1970)
- after praising the speech: "As one of the most successful speeches in America’s history, Barack Obama's Victory Speech maintains most of the prominent features of speeches as a special discourse type. The above factors make contributions to the reliability and validity of the research result of this paper."
- "The Interpersonal Metafunction of a speech represents the way the addresser and the audience interact, the use of language to establish and maintain relations with them, to influence their behavior, to express our own viewpoint on things in the world, and to elicit or change theirs. It mainly concerns the Roles of Addressers and Audience, Mood and Modality."
- **Mood**: "a component is indispensable for carrying out the Interpersonal Metafunction of the clause as exchange in English."
  - four basic speech roles in any communicative language (Halliday (1994:69))
  - "The purpose of a speech is to express the addresser’s viewpoint on things in the world, to elicit or change the audience’s attitudes and to arouse the audiences’ passion to share the same proposal of the addresser."
  - Subject^Finite pattern dominant => declarative clauses dominate
  - "On one hand, the addresser hopes to offer certain messages to the audience showing his political attitude and assumption. On the other hand, he tries to demand and arouse the audience to take action to follow his instruction. Therefore, complete declarative clauses generally dominate in a political speech; imperative clauses come next to them; and interrogative clauses are the last choices for the reason that they may make a speech less solemn, less convincing and persuasive. "
  - 108 major clauses 
  - declarative 101
    - => statements => giving much information to audience:  "recalling his presidential election campaign, expressing his gratitude to his supporters, making promises and inspiring the audience to go through the difficulties with the whole nation."
  - imperative 5
    - "appeal the audience to follow the addresser’s instruction" + "build up the authority of the addresser"
    - 2 kinds: "to command others to do something" & "to invite the audience to do something together". Obama uses #2, successfully shortening the distance + "maintains an equal and reliant relation with the audience, which is helpful in moving the audience with emotion"
  - interrogative 2
    - creating intimate dialogic style; "used to attract the audience’s attention" + "to emphasize in order to make the audience think and rouse their passion for overcoming the current difficulties"
- **Modality** ("speaker’s judgments of the probabilities or the obligations involved in what she is saying")
  - "different scales of modal commitment lead to different meanings"
  - many ways of realisation, among others via modal verbal operators
    - will 18/55 (high level): 7x as future tense marker, 11x to show strong wish and determination
      - "constant use of “will” in the data is successful in showing Barack Obama's strong mind and keen desire to lead American to go through the difficulties"
    - can 22/55 (low level)
      - "Obama uses “can” to weaken his authority, to shorten the distance between him and the audience and not to force and command them to follow his instruction"
      - semantically, can = ability. "... is to encourage American to believe in themselves to be confident that they have the ability to do anything"
    - must 4/55 (highest level)
      - "helps to show Barack Obama's firm determination to overcome the difficulties and call on the American to take strong actions to achieve their target"
- **Personal pronoun**
  - 1st: 75%
    - we, us, our: 56%
      - incusive we: 33/40: "paints Obama into a common citizen as hundreds of thousands of Americans, which suggest that he and all the Americans are in the same boat. In this way, Obama successfully shortens the distance between him and the audience and maintains an equal and reliant relationship between them, thus greatly helps to persuade the audience to share his same proposal"
      - exclusive we: 7/40: "signals that Obama and his government are a strong team with high spirit, holding powerful authority and determination to protect their citizen and lead their nation to a bright future" => building confidence in elected government
    - I: 19%
      - "“I” here successfully describes the new elected president into a sincere person who will remember the gratitude and try to repay it."
  - you, your: 13%
    - "“you” can help to create a dialogic style in the speech, maintaining a close intimate relation between the addresser and the audience, and thus to ensure the effective interaction"
    - "With “you” Obama shows his care and respect to the audience"
    - "“we”-“you”-“we” pattern in Barack Obama's Victory Speech successfully creates a dialogic style, which successfully shortens the distance between Obama and other Americans, and that is significant for Obama to win widespread support for his new government. "
  - he/she, they: 12%
- **Conclusions**
  - positive declarative clauses dominate Barack Obama's Victory Speech; 
  - imperative clauses are in the second position;
  - “will”, “can” and “must” turn up frequently as modal verbal operators to carry on the modality in the speech; 
  - the first personal pronoun and its anamorphous turn up mostly in Barack Obama's Victory Speech, the second personal pronoun “you” come next
  - **Recommendations**
    - Positive declarative clauses are recommended to convey as many as possible messages to the audience and convince the audience with fact; appropriate application of imperative clauses are useful in making persuasion and suggestion
    - Modal verbal operators with higher or highest modal commitment can show the addresser’s firm determination to finish the task, and “can” is helpful to encourage the audience to have confidence in their ability.
    - Choosing “We” to be the personal pronoun and applying “we”-“you” –“we” pattern can help to create an intimate dialogic style and shorten the distance between the addresser and the audience, which can further persuade the audience to share the same proposal of the addresser. 

## Comparing the speeches
- as an inauguration speech, it's meant for a wider audience than a victory speech: meant for every citizen. also, presenting the programme of the new administration.
- 106 sentences (2399w) vs 41(889w) in Mandela and 107(2040w) in Obama
