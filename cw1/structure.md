- Introduction
  - political speech is clearly a tool, i.e. it aims to to influence, persuade, win the audience, and diminish the opposition
  - a successful speech will bridge gaps, make audience identify with the message, believe and support the speaker
  - Nur & Ruijuan analyse the ways in which 2 successful political speeches achieve this
  - in particular, they analyse the interpersonal metafunction (proposed by Halliday in context of SFL) of the language, focusing on mood modality and pronoun
  - they observe that the most dominant tools employed are positive declaratives, modals with high degree of modal committment, plural 1st person pronouns
  - they also notice less frequent but effective careful use of imperatives, 2nd & 3rd person pronouns
  - to see how their findings generalise, I apply their approach to Obama's inauguration speech

- Theoretical background
  - Halliday developed SFL
  - language is functionally organised, it's shaped by the functions that is serves
  - Halliday describes 3 such metafunctions and argues that, subsequently, the meaning of a language can be explained from the corresponding 3 different perspectives (_strands of meaning_):
    - **experiential** metafunction as use of language for talking about reality, human experience of the world, etc., constituting **ideational** meaning
    - **interpersonal** metafunction -- language as tool/medium for social interaction; giving rise to the **interpersonal** (social) meaning concerned with interactions, relationships, etc
    - **textual** metafunction -- language as a communicative tool, a message -- the surface form, constructed so as to fit well with the local context (preceding messages) as well as wider (e.g. social) context of the message, leading to the **textual** meaning about language as a message
  - the 3 metafunctions are intertwined, but the interpersonal one is the most important one in political speeches as it describes how language can be employed as a tool to bring the speaker closer to their audience (lessen the _social distance_), establish a positive or close relationship, influence, persuade, inspire the audience, etc.

- My data
  - while Nur and Ruijuan come to similar conclusions, the speeches are quite different:
    - one is inaugural, the other victory
    - one occurs after defeating the apartheid in South Africa in 1994, the other is situated in the US, 15 years later, amidst the global financial crisis
  - I chose Obama's 2009 inauguration speech because I expect interesting similarities and differences with previous speeches:
    - at the basic level, it's a presidential speech (like the others)
    - as an inauguration speech, it could be close (=> better comparable) to Mandela's speech more than the victory speech analysed by Ruijuan
    - as a speech by Obama, and coming only 2.5 months after his victory speech, I expect it to be similar
    - on the other hand, differences with Obama2008 can be related to the different occasions (election victory vs inauguration), audiences and purposes:
      - while the victory speech was aimed primarily for Obama's supporters, the inaugural speech was widely televised and addressed to all Americans and even to other nations
      - compared to victory speech, inauguration speech focuses more on presenting the main topics and program of the new president+government
      - it aims to unite all Americans and present US as a world leader

- Analysis
  - I analyse the dimensions of IM explored by both Nur and Ruijuan, i.e. mood, modality and personal pronouns.
  - Mood
    - The concept of Mood relates to the very nature of clause as exchange
    - provides basis for interactions between addresser and audience in the form of 4 basic speech functions as exchanges of 2 types of commodity: statement (giving information), question (demanding information), offer (giving goods & services), and command (demanding g&s)
    - the mood itself is in a clause represented by subject + finite (typically the subject-verb pair)
    - in English, difference between the most dominant speech functions (declarative statements & interrogative questions) surfaces as the different orderings of subject and finite
    - observe declarative/imperative/interrogative: 106/9/0: 92/8/0%
      - Ruijuan: 101/5/2: 93.5/4.6/0.9%
      - Nur: 36/5/0: 88/12/0%
    - declarative examples
      - "On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord."
    - imperatives addressed to "others" countries and potential enemies (3x), and to all Americans (the Let form, 3x)
    - imperative example:
      - "[To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West,] know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy."
    - similar to previous findings. more imperatives in inaugural vs victory speeches may be attributed to presenting program and encouraging people to join and act in accordance with it
  - Modality
    - covering the range of meanings between yes and no, modality refers to how speaker's position, (un)certainty, (in)ability and attitude surface in semantic meaning
    - one can go further and distinguish between:
      - modalization as speaker's judgement of proposition in terms of probablity (possible -> certain) and usuality (sometimes->always)
      - modulation as expressing speaker's sense of obligation (allowed->required) and inclination (willing->determined)
      - but Halliday 1970 argues that these are "the same system in different functions", whereas modalization changes the meaning at the interpersonal level while modulation changes the content of the proposition at the ideational level
    - both can be realised in various forms, using e.g. modal verbs, adjectives, adverbs...
    - I limit myself to modal verbs, analysed in Nur and Ruijuan
                | will/won't (future/wish) | would | must | can/cannot | could | be able to
    - observed: | 19         (13/6)        | 1     | 8(6) | 12/6       | 0     | 0
    - Ruijuan:  | 18         (7/11)        | 0     | 4    | 22         | 0     | 0
    - Nur:      | 6          (?/?)         | ?     | 3    | 1          | 1     | 1

    - 1st
    - 2nd
    - 3rd

**Conclusions (Nur)**
  - "the use of mood and personal pronoun outweighs the use of modals and rhythmic lexical features; but all together they work within the same frame to explicate the speaker’s interpersonal metafunction"
  - "different uses of mood, modals, personal pronouns and rhythmic features of words can convey different levels of interpersonal meaning: different status, purpose, meaning and relationship between the speaker and the audience."
  - Recommendations
    - "Use of appropriate quantity of positive declarative clauses to transmit messages to the audience clearly and directly; appropriate application of imperative clauses to persuade and suggest."
    - "Use of modals under the highest modal commitment to show the speaker’s strong spirit and determination to achieve any task and also to promote audience’s onfidence in their ability"
	- "Use of personal pronoun, especially we-our-you-their pattern to abridge the speaker –audience distance by creating a dialogic style and also by pleading the audience to share the same feelings and attitude."

**Conclusions (Ruijuan)**
  - positive declarative clauses dominate Barack Obama's Victory Speech; 
  - imperative clauses are in the second position;
  - “will”, “can” and “must” turn up frequently as modal verbal operators to carry on the modality in the speech; 
  - the first personal pronoun and its anamorphous turn up mostly in Barack Obama's Victory Speech, the second personal pronoun “you” come next
  - **Recommendations**
    - Positive declarative clauses are recommended to convey as many as possible messages to the audience and convince the audience with fact; appropriate application of imperative clauses are useful in making persuasion and suggestion
    - Modal verbal operators with higher or highest modal commitment can show the addresser’s firm determination to finish the task, and “can” is helpful to encourage the audience to have confidence in their ability.
    - Choosing “We” to be the personal pronoun and applying “we”-“you” –“we” pattern can help to create an intimate dialogic style and shorten the distance between the addresser and the audience, which can further persuade the audience to share the same proposal of the addresser.
