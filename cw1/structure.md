intro
- political speech is a tool and does this, this, that
- IM is great for analysing these things
- Nur & Ruijuan analyse IM in political speeches, on Mandela's 1994 inauguration and Obama's 2009 victory speech
- they analyse the same elements of IM, and they come to very similar conclusions w.r.t use of and role of IM elements in the two speeches
- I challenge this, hypothesising that actually differences between inauguration and victory speeches could surface in the use of IM
- victory is for supporters who already support the person, while inauguration is for everyone and needs to unite while presenting plans
- I chose Obama's inauguration so that as many properties as possible stay the same (speaker, time period, affiliation, etc) and only the occasion changes
- I'll explore the same IM elements Ruijuan did and will compare with Ruijuan's findings

conclusions

- Introduction
  - political speech is clearly a tool, i.e. it aims to to influence, persuade, win the audience, and diminish the opposition
  - a successful speech will bridge gaps, make audience identify with the message, believe and support the speaker
  - Nur & Ruijuan analyse the ways in which 2 successful political speeches achieve this
  - in particular, they analyse the interpersonal metafunction (proposed by Halliday in context of SFL) of the language, focusing on mood modality and pronoun
  - they observe that the most dominant tools employed are positive declaratives, modals with high degree of modal committment, plural 1st person pronouns
  - they also notice less frequent but effective careful use of imperatives, 2nd & 3rd person pronouns
  - to see how their findings generalise, I apply their approach to Obama's inauguration speech

- Theoretical background
  - Halliday developed SFL
  - language is functionally organised, it's shaped by the functions that is serves
  - Halliday describes 3 such metafunctions and argues that, subsequently, the meaning of a language can be explained from the corresponding 3 different perspectives (_strands of meaning_):
    - **experiential** metafunction as use of language for talking about reality, human experience of the world, etc., constituting **ideational** meaning
    - **interpersonal** metafunction -- language as tool/medium for social interaction; giving rise to the **interpersonal** (social) meaning concerned with interactions, relationships, etc
    - **textual** metafunction -- language as a communicative tool, a message -- the surface form, constructed so as to fit well with the local context (preceding messages) as well as wider (e.g. social) context of the message, leading to the **textual** meaning about language as a message
  - the 3 metafunctions are intertwined, but the interpersonal one is the most important one in political speeches as it describes how language can be employed as a tool to bring the speaker closer to their audience (lessen the _social distance_), establish a positive or close relationship, influence, persuade, inspire the audience, etc.

- My data
  - while Nur and Ruijuan come to similar conclusions, the speeches are quite different:
    - one is inaugural, the other victory
    - one occurs after defeating the apartheid in South Africa in 1994, the other is situated in the US, 15 years later, amidst the global financial crisis
  - I chose Obama's 2009 inauguration speech because I expect interesting similarities and differences with previous speeches:
    - at the basic level, it's a presidential speech (like the others)
    - as an inauguration speech, it could be close (=> better comparable) to Mandela's speech more than the victory speech analysed by Ruijuan
    - as a speech by Obama, and coming only 2.5 months after his victory speech, I expect it to be similar
    - on the other hand, differences with Obama2008 can be related to the different occasions (election victory vs inauguration), audiences and purposes:
      - while the victory speech was aimed primarily for Obama's supporters, the inaugural speech was widely televised and addressed to all Americans and even to other nations
      - compared to victory speech, inauguration speech focuses more on presenting the main topics and program of the new president+government
      - it aims to unite all Americans and present US as a world leader

- Analysis
  - I analyse the dimensions of IM explored by both Nur and Ruijuan, i.e. mood, modality and personal pronouns.
  - Mood
    - The concept of Mood relates to the very nature of clause as exchange
    - provides basis for interactions between addresser and audience in the form of 4 basic speech functions as exchanges of 2 types of commodity: statement (giving information), question (demanding information), offer (giving goods & services), and command (demanding g&s)
    - the mood itself is in a clause represented by subject + finite (typically the subject-verb pair)
    - in English, difference between the most dominant speech functions (declarative statements & interrogative questions) surfaces as the different orderings of subject and finite (perhaps useless fact)
    - declarative/imperative/interrogative
      - observed: 106/9/0: 92/8/0%
      - Ruijuan: 101/5/2: 94/5/1%
      - Nur: 36/5/0: 88/12/0%
    - **previous findings**:
      - Nur: 
        - declarative clauses dominate {_making the speech solemn and persuasive, thrivingly recalling Mandela and his countrymen’s long sufferings, expressing gratitude to cowarriors and supporters and promising to work for the actual freedom_}
        - followed by imperatives (non-commanding Let) {_helping Mandela arouse people’s passion to dream and act together to earn equality & freedom; minimizes the social distance; making speech more emotive, appealing, and inspiring._}
      - Ruijuan:
        - declaratives dominate {_give as much as possible information to the audience, recalling election campaign, expressing gratitude to supporters, promising, inspiring the audience to face difficulties as one_}
        - imperatives (Let) follow {_shorten distance, call to act together & overcome the difficulties.; make speech more moving, appealing and inspiring_}
    - declarative examples
      - "On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord."
    - imperatives addressed to "others" countries and potential enemies (3x), and to all Americans (the Let form, 3x)
    - imperative example:
      - "[To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West,] know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy."
    - similar to previous findings. more imperatives in inaugural vs victory speeches may be attributed to presenting program and encouraging people to join and act in accordance with it
  - Modality
    - covering the range of meanings between yes and no, modality refers to how speaker's position, (un)certainty, (in)ability and attitude surface in semantic meaning
    - one can go further and distinguish between:
      - modalization as speaker's judgement of proposition in terms of probablity (possible -> certain) and usuality (sometimes->always)
      - modulation as expressing speaker's sense of obligation (allowed->required) and inclination (willing->determined)
      - but Halliday 1970 argues that these are "the same system in different functions", whereas modalization changes the meaning at the interpersonal level while modulation changes the content of the proposition at the ideational level
    - both can be realised in various forms, using e.g. modal verbs, adjectives, adverbs...
    - I limit myself to modal verbs, analysed in Nur and Ruijuan

    - **previous findings**
      - Nur
        - will dominates (as future predicator & symbol of determination)
        - must follows {_conveys strong determination; calls audience to be determined to act towards common objectives_}
        - scarse can {_encourages people to believe in their abilities to act together; minimizes gap_}
      - Ruijuan
        - can dominates {_weaken authority & shorten distance. 'Be able' showed in repeated “Yes we can”, encourages people to believe in themselves & ability to climb back into the light_}
        - will follows {_shows strong mind and keen desire to lead through the difficulties; higher modal commitment confirms more actions will be definitely taken in the future_}
        - must follows {_shows firm determination to overcome difficulties, call to actions to achieve targets_}
    - Most dominant is the high commitment (will, must), but note that of 19 wills only 6 communicate strong will/determination, while 13 are simply markers of future tense. also, I identify 2 cases of must which I don't see as communicating urge, but simply obligation:
      - "Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land; a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that the next generation must lower its sights."
      - "It must be earned."
    - can is also dominant, BUT used only in 2x cases to strongly communicate the ability (in all other cases it's either negative, or communicating in a rather ordinary way the possibility/ability) -- note that Obama here doesn't use 'yes we can':
      - "All this we can do."
      - "Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort, even greater cooperation and understanding between nations."
    - I think the mostly future use of will (compared with Obama's victory speech) is because now he talks about the program, i.e. what the new government will do. The victory speech was perhaps more about general determination than concrete plans.

    - **previous findings**
      - Nur
        - 1st: plural replaces singular {_inclusive kindles to feel same as Mandela, come forward & work together. exclusive implies authority & power. government integrated with people, grateful, with high spirit and powerful, ready to protect and unite._}
        - 2nd: least frequent {_crosses audience’s boundary, shows humble gratitude to international body_}
        - 3rd: frequent {_shows care/respect to people who died during the struggle, invites audience to feel same. Ties speaker+audience in intimate bondage_}
      - Ruijuan
        - 1st: most frequent, mainly plural, {_'I' makes Obama sincere person who remembers gratitude and will repay it. Inclusive 'we' makes Obama on the same boat as audience & persuades to share his proposals. Exclusive 'we' makes them strong leaders; wins Americans’ confidence in new government._}
        - 2nd: infrequent {_“you” attracts attention + creates dialogical feel; Obama shows care/respect to audience => intimate relation_}
        - 3rd: infrequent
        
    - 1st person dominates, exclusively plural: aiming to unite people and portray Obama as one of them (compare with victory speech where I is used often). we is found in 53% of all main clauses (compare with 38% in victory and 66% in Mandela -- this shows how inauguration is different from victory)
    - 2nd person used almost exclusively to address (confront) 3rd parties such as foreign countries (including enemies), setting a strong (and somewhat patronising) tone
    - 3rd person (mainly they/their) is used to refer to those not present, mainly to earlier generations who worked/fought hard so the present-day Americans could live decent lives, and to American soldiers. By referring to these shared American values and symbols, Obama unites the audience.

**Conclusions (Nur)**
  - "the use of mood and personal pronoun outweighs the use of modals and rhythmic lexical features; but all together they work within the same frame to explicate the speaker’s interpersonal metafunction"
  - "different uses of mood, modals, personal pronouns and rhythmic features of words can convey different levels of interpersonal meaning: different status, purpose, meaning and relationship between the speaker and the audience."
  - Recommendations
    - "Use of appropriate quantity of positive declarative clauses to transmit messages to the audience clearly and directly; appropriate application of imperative clauses to persuade and suggest."
    - "Use of modals under the highest modal commitment to show the speaker’s strong spirit and determination to achieve any task and also to promote audience’s onfidence in their ability"
	- "Use of personal pronoun, especially we-our-you-their pattern to abridge the speaker –audience distance by creating a dialogic style and also by pleading the audience to share the same feelings and attitude."

**Conclusions (Ruijuan)**
  - positive declarative clauses dominate Barack Obama's Victory Speech; 
  - imperative clauses are in the second position;
  - “will”, “can” and “must” turn up frequently as modal verbal operators to carry on the modality in the speech; 
  - the first personal pronoun and its anamorphous turn up mostly in Barack Obama's Victory Speech, the second personal pronoun “you” come next
  - **Recommendations**
    - Positive declarative clauses are recommended to convey as many as possible messages to the audience and convince the audience with fact; appropriate application of imperative clauses are useful in making persuasion and suggestion
    - Modal verbal operators with higher or highest modal commitment can show the addresser’s firm determination to finish the task, and “can” is helpful to encourage the audience to have confidence in their ability.
    - Choosing “We” to be the personal pronoun and applying “we”-“you” –“we” pattern can help to create an intimate dialogic style and shorten the distance between the addresser and the audience, which can further persuade the audience to share the same proposal of the addresser.
