IDA CW2 questions
Is interpretation still so important? I guess it is, yet I often find it difficult to interpret the findings when analysing spoken discourse, since the "decisions" made by the speakers are often quite spontaneous and unconscious anyway (compared to written discourse, where I can reason about particular devices used in particular ways with particular purpose).
Same goes for recommendations: I know that you can use spoken discourse analysis to e.g. help doctor-patient interaction, but I find it difficult to think of good recommendations when going back to the in-class analysis of short excerpts from driver-police officer exchange or the rugby club changing room...
Finally, about presenting the piece of data: Again, how important is it now to comment on the data, how interesting/suitable it is for the particular kind of analysis, etc., given that I did not actually choose the data, but rather it was given to me?
